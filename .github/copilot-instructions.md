This workspace contains project documentation and guides for the treatment and prevention of migraine, with a special focus on adolescents living with Type 1 diabetes and migraine.

Guidelines:

- This is not a software or development project: no code should be generated or edited.
- All deliverables are written guides, recommendations, and preventive strategies in plain text or Markdown format.
- Recommendations should be evidence-based, clearly explained, and actionable.
- Use simple, patient-friendly terminology and structure content with headings, lists, and step-by-step instructions.
- When referencing medical information, cite reputable sources (e.g., clinical guidelines, peer-reviewed research). But only if available. Dont make up sources!
